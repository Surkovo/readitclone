Video 7
- change the blues in the tailwind config file
_ create _docmument.tsx with next.js to edit the html of pages outside of the the React JSX
- insert the links for the font in the Head of the do created/ Make sure to self close the link tags
- then edit the tailwind config to use the font. add a class to the body in the doc to use the font
- we can import axios in the app.tsx and let the sub components use it. Set the axios defaults to use the url we want.
- be sure to install cors and it's types so the server and the client can interact
- useClassnames for conditional classes on an element
- React is auto imported to every next.js component, so no need for an import statement at the top 
- Use ctrl space to get intellisense for typescript
- add withCredentials the to post axios calls to post cookies to the browser. This forwards the cookies with each request

- added additional spacing option to the tailwind config
- deleted home.module.css. and renamed globals.css file to tailwind.css
- changed to tailwind.css to add custom classes for a particular directory. See the @layer and the components name it's targetinog

Video 9
- we disabled the container class within tailwind.config. Then used a plugin to redefine it yourselves with a function. Destructure out addComponent 
- we can target screen size using the @screen function in tailwind
- we added the types file to keep intellisense on the client side
- added dayjs and realtive time plugin to display time
- see notes the Post Entity to see hwo to create the URL field the post response
- disable "nounusedlocals in the tsconfig temporarily to 
- added the get serverprops funciton in the index fiel. serverside render the props as apposed to client side once the page is calle

Video 10 
- Created the votes Entity 
- added misc route to handle the vote and direct it to either a post or comment
- added Vote array to both the Post and Comment Entity
- created a  migration for the votes Entity: npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -n create-votes-table
- npm run typeorm migration:run
- I commented out the create migration and create user table since those had already been ran and the tables were in the DB
- added virtual fields to the DB for comment and vote count on a post 
- excluxed the Votes from the response to hide who voted for what. 
- added the virutal field userVotes to both Psot and Comment. 
- then used that function in the misc to fetch the comments and its, as well use the setUservotes function to check if the user voted on all the comments before returning the post in the response.

- now if you have a route that needs a user to be logged in you need both auth and user middleware
- added user middleware to routes in auth middleware that need them 
- added the user middleware to the getPosts route
- the reason for the user middleware is that if the user is loggedin then the getPosts route returns the votes for that user, if user isn't logged in then, no votes will show since the aren't logged in. getPosts is the home page that anyone can see
- added showing user votes to the post card since we created teh user middleware


Video 10 
- create context folder and auth.tsx file for that context
- added the user type in the types.ts file  
- created a reducer to tell the context what to do when an action is dispatched

- created custom useContext hooks for those hooks
- added the context to the app.tsx
-added the useAuthDispatch to set the context state after getting the user
- use the dispatch and pass the action type and the payload. this gets loaded into the authContext
- get the auth state for the navbar.tsx
- the reason for create two different contexts is to avoid nested Destructuring when using the state
- create a logout button in the navbar to conditionally show the login buttons
- create a useEffect call in the authContext to get cookies if the user is logged already
- created custom dispatch with in the context to stop Destructuring everywhere. besure to udpate where the old dispatch was being used with the new args

- created new seed folder in the src dir
- drop everything in  the data base: npm run typeorm schema:drop, then recreate the DB: npm run typeorm migration:run , then seed it with: 
- added SWR to the project, this check before a fetch request fro cached data. can kind work as a deduper
- npm i swr in the client folder, add the import for in the app.tsx, use SWRconfig, pass the value in a callback. and what to do with in the res.send. Check the other option you can pass to the SWR config
- then  in the index file to get the data
- rearranged the link tags in the postcard to make it work
- added subs route to get one sub. getSub routes

- deploy to digital ocean
- add env variables to the orm config. added them to the .env file
-renamed ormconfig.json to ormconfig.js
- added rootDir typeORM config to have it read from on place if the server is local, and another if it's in the cloud hoste'readit
- added this rootDir to all the paths in the typeORM config. be sure to remove src since it depends on the rootDir
- add {.ts * .js } to all directory extension to make sure it works in both dev and build 
- add logging check in typeORM config for logging
- run 'npx tsc' to build server code to test this rootDir variable
- add include and exclude option in the tsconfig.json (server one, not the the client tsconfig) to make tell npx tsc which files to build
- ran this npm i --save-dev @types/faker  to avoid compile error when running npm tsc. 
- run "node build/server.ts" to make sure the .env file is picked up
- change npm start in the package.json to "node build/server.js". we do this so it can run on the server. 
- you can change the env variables in the cli so do NODE_ENV=production then "npm start"
- add "/api" to the "/" route in server.ts
- test the server in another terminal using curl, curl localhost:5000 or curl localhost:5000/api/posts
- we do a similar process for the client side, add another env variable to .env.local for the next.config to work on the server
- run npm run build in the client folder to build the project. this puts the build in the a newly created .next folder
- now to run all of our JS run npm start in readitclone folder, then in another terminal cd into the client folder and run npm start there. be sure to change the NODE_ENV ahead of the start script on the server for it work correctly
- comment out secure option on the auth.ts route since it needs HTTPS in production to work
- if you make changes to the server code you will have to npx tsc to rebuild it
- create .env.example. this a reminder for you for what to set up on the server .env file. do the same in the client
- added git to main readitclone directory. had to remove git from client directory
- created digital ocean droplet, then used id_rsa.pub on my computers root dir to ssh into my digital ocean server. See command on digital ocean. then create droplet
- copy the ip from the newly created server. now ssh from your desktop into the server doing the following: ssh root@IPADDERESSERVER
- now install node.js on the server by going to nodejs nodesource git hub. copy install ubuntu commands 
- now go to github repo and get deploy key
- run $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" on the server to get new ssh key. just keep hitting enter on prompts
- then cd into ssh on the server and: cat rsa.pub  (or whater the public name is). copy that value
- now use the ssh clone option to get the code on github. cd back to root on server and run: git clone git@github.com:Surkovo/readitclone.git
- cd into the repo. run npm install
- now install postgres on the server. google download postgress ubuntu. follow these steps: https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/
- now sign into postgres using: sudo -i -u postgres. now run psql then CREATE DATABASE readit;
- give the postgres user a password with the following: ALTER USER  postgres WITH PASSWORD '123456'. Since the postgres port on the server isn't open to the public by default, it is ok to have a weak password
- \q to quit psql. and: exit. this gets us out of postgres. 
- be sure to change .env example to one with values, you can use the following to change the file name: cp .env.example .env
- use vim to edit the file with the env variables. JWT secret can be whateverk
- now that the DB is setup run: NODE_ENV=development npm run typeorm migration:run      //be sure to run it with the node env changed so it runs the JS files, not the ts 
- run: NODE_ENV=development npm run seed  to get data into the db
- run: npx tsc to build it on the local server
- then run: npm start
- open and run another terminal and ssh into the server on that terminal as well
- curl localhost:5000/api to see if it running. if you see hello world its running 
- now set up the client. cd into then run npm install , run: npm audit fix --force   <-- this will force install the audit fixes. DONT DO THIS. IT upgrades to webpack 5 and messes with the build process. do more research later
- be sure to set up the .env file in the client so VIM and cp change the name like in the server. the values should be something similar to what in the server .env. get the urls from there
- now run: npm run build
- I had to delete a random import in the register page. weird
- run npm start on client, then in the other terminal curl to localhost:3000, it should server the html as a response
- npm install -g pm2 on the server. this lets us run both the server and client in the background on the droplet. Run the below commands to create process in a given folder
- to use pm2 run the following script: pm2 start --name "server" npm -- start  <---- run this one in the readit directory
- cd into client then run: pm2 start --name "client" npm --start
- now to serve the servers to the public we have to install nginx on the droplet. Google how to do this: install nginx on ubuntu. follow the steps
- after installing nginx you can go the droplet ip and it should show nginx
- cd into /etc/nginx/site-available to change which sites are being served by nginx. vim default
- comment out the root line. comment out the try file line
- add /api after the location line. added line inside the {}: proxy_pass: http/localhost:5000/api. 
- added location /images { proxy_pass http://localhost/images} . see file for more examples 
- we did this so all /api and /images go to the server, and all / go to the client. save the new default file.
- restart nginx with systemctl restart nginx
- refresh the droplet address and you should see the client page being served!
- cp bricks.jpg ../../../public/images/bricks.jpg <- we had to move the client images to server side because of the nginx location mapping
--  I HAVE TO REMOVE THE PUBLIC FROM THE SERVER GIT  IGNORE FILE TO ENSURE THE IMAGES GET UPLOADED TO THE SERVER CORRECTLY.

Video 25
- do a git reset to undo the changes on the server since you shouldn't change prod on the server. you what to push it up from a local dev environment
- do this with the following command since your changes weren't committed: git reset --hard
- since we moved the brick.jpg to server public images folder, delete the bricks.jpg in the client and update the imports on the pages files
- google github action ssh to get that github action
- nam folder in the project called .github/workflows/WHATEVER
- the secrets in the main.yml file are on the github repo
